    "Dear reader,\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I am goind to discuss a very important technique of **Hypothesis Testing** called the **Analysis of Variance** or **ANOVA**. ANOVA is a pool of techniques that relate/integrate so many other techniques/topics such as: **t-test**, **z-test**, **Inflation of error (Type I)** etc. Don't worry if you are not familiar with the terms and jargons, I will keep my promise ([made here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/subhadeep1024/Blogs/blob/master/Welcome.ipynb)) that the posts will be modular and start with very lighter note.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is an advanced and complicated topic and it takes time to grasp the intuition and underlying hypothesis to be tested by ANOVA. So I will take baby steps and in this post, I will only state an example and construct the foundation of the hypothesis to be tested by ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's start with an example. Consider a farmer saw advertisements on several fertilizers and each one claim to result in better growth. So the farmer asked for samples from each of the three companies and applied them on 3 groups of saplings (small/baby trees) on 3 different plots. Consider that the farmer had 1000 samples and the initial height of the saplings were around 140 cm (mean = 140, sd = 2), we call this group as **control** group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's assume that he selected some saplings randomly from the **control** group, transplanted them into 3 plots and applied one (out of the 3) fertilizer on the saplings at each plot. Let's consider the number of saplings selected in plot1, plot2 and plot3 are n1, n2 and n3. For ease of understanding we'll assume the number of saplings transplanted at each plot are same, *i.e.* n1 = n2 = n3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next he measured the length of the saplings after 1 month to understand if there is any difference between the average lentgh of the saplings treated by 3 different fertilizers. The observations are summarized in the following table."
