    "Wow!! So many `jargons` ehh??? \n",
    "\n",
    "Relax, they may look frightening like demons but their usage is pretty simple. The idea behind ANOVA is to interpret the ratio of `MSG`/`MSE`, *i.e* the **F-statistic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand the idea step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Ideally, The `Grand mean` should represent all the samples, *i.e,* this mean should be an ideal model of all the samples. But this rarely happens in reality, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered to developed sophisticated algorithms to model our data. The `SST` represents the total deviation of all the samples (*i.e.* the 40 saplings) from the ideal `Grand mean` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Similarly, the `Group means` should represent the samples under the corresponding groups, *i.e,* each `Group mean` should be an ideal model of the samples in corresponding groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Our natural intuition says that the `Group means` should represent the samples better than the `Grand mean`. So the total deviation of each sample from their respective `Group means` (which is `SSG`), should be less than the collective deviation of each sample from the `Grand mean` (the `SST`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) But the samples under same groups may be very different from each other. So, even the `Group means` may not be the ideal representation of the samples within corresponding groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) So none of the `Grand mean` and the `Group means` represent the individual samples well. Therefore there will be differences (errors) between the `Grand mean` and the samples, as well the between each `Group mean` and the corresponding group samples. This first error is called the `SST` and the second one is called `SSG` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) As the `Group means` are better representative (better model) of the samples than the `Grand mean`, the `SSG` will be smaller than `SST`. The residual errors that is left out, *i.e.* `SST` - `SSG` = `SSE` is the error that remains unexplained. In other words, the value of `SSE` represents how better our model still could be: Higher the value, inferior the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) We assumed that the groups may be different from each other. So we expect that there would be a deviation of each `Group mean` from `Grand mean`. That is, we have an explanation for this deviation. This error is nothing but `SSG` and thus, `SSG` may be though as **explained error** \n",
    "\n",
    "8) So, the Total error is divided isnto two parts: **explained** and **unexplained**.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) The idea of ANOVA is nothing but to compare the **average unexplained error** (`MSE`) with the **average explained error** (`MSG`), and the **F-statistic** is noting but the ratio of this average **explained / unexplained** error.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Both `MSG` and `MSE` are average squarred errors from means and we have specific name for this metric. Can you guess that name?? Yes, this is nothing but ***variance***. Now it makes sense why this method is called ***Analysis of variance*** right??\n",
    "\n",
    "11) can you imagine what could be the source of the **unexplained error** ? One common source may be that the samples under each geoup are very different from other. But, in our present framework, we considered only the Fertilizers would result in different heights and totally excluded that this difference could also arise due to the genetic variation among the saplings. So in our example, the **unexplained error** may be due to the individual genetic variations of the sample saplings.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) We often call this type of **unexplained** error as **within-group error** . \n"
